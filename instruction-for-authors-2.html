The deadline for full paper submission is August 6, 2018.</p><p>Accepted and presented papers will be submitted to IEEE Xplore. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore® Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.</p><h3>Formatting Instructions</h3><ul><li>Papers are <strong>limited to 6 pages</strong> including figures, tables, and references.</li><li>Prepare papers using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180925201332/https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Manuscript Template</a>.</li><li>Be sure to specify <strong>A4 paper</strong> and to use the template’s <strong>conference mode</strong>. For example, with the IEEE Manuscript LaTeX Template, the following configuration line can be included:<pre>\documentclass[conference,a4paper]{IEEEtran}</pre></li><li>Ensure the submitted papers are blind. <strong>None of the author’s names or affiliations should be included or disclosed in the submitted paper.</strong> The author names are required for camera-ready version.</li></ul><h3>Submission Instructions</h3><ul><li>All submissions will be handled electronically via the EasyChair Conference Management System. Authors are therefore required to have EasyChair accounts by registering through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180925201332/https://easychair.org/">EasyChair home page</a>.</li><li>Submit papers by logging in to EasyChair, going directly to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180925201332/https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icodse2018">ICoDSE page on EasyChair</a>, and selecting the New Submission menu.</li><li>Add authors by entering their names, email address, and other details as indicated in the submission form. Make sure to use co-author’s email addresses that correspond exactly to their EasyChair accounts (assuming they have created accounts). Upload papers by first making sure to check the relevant and required check boxes.</li></ul><h3>Further Policies</h3><p>All authors must agree to the policies stipulated below.</p><h4>Author’s responsibilities</h4><p>The submitted paper must be original, does not contain any plagiarism, and has not been submitted to any other conferences or journals. The ICoDSE 2018 Committee retains the right to exclude any papers in violation of these requirements.</p><h4>Dual/double submissions</h4><p>By submitting a paper to ICoDSE 2018, the authors guarantee that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication (in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference, workshop, or archival forums) in substantially similar form. Furthermore, no paper which contains significant overlap with the submitted paper is either under review at the moment of submission or will be submitted during the ICoDSE 2018 review period to another conference, a workshop, or a journal. The ICoDSE 2018 Committee retains the right to exclude any papers in violation of these requirements.</p><h4>Conflict responsibilities</h4><p>It is the primary author’s responsibility to ensure that all authors of the paper have provided their affiliations in the EasyChair system. For each author, please enter <strong>only one</strong> institution, except when the author was in more than one institution in the last 12 months. This information will be used to resolve paper assignments to both reviewers and area chairs. If an author is found to have an undeclared or incorrect affiliation, his/her paper may be summarily rejected.</p><h4>Double-blind review</h4><p>ICoDSE 2018 adopts the double-blind review process. Authors in this case do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers and area chairs/reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Avoid providing information (e.g. in the forms of citations, acknowledgments, links to websites) in the paper that may identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review.</p><h4>Attendance responsibilities</h4><p>The authors agree that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper there.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on 23 March 2021</div></aside></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><div><a href="./important-dates.html" class="featured__title">Important Dates</a></div></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="./">ICoDSE 2021</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2021</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
