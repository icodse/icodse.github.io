Conference Registration</h3><p>Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference. Every paper accepted for ICoDSE 2022 must have an associated registration at the full member or non-member author rate. At least one author of each accepted paper must be registered for the conference by<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 28 October 2021</span> in order for that paper to appear in the proceedings and to be scheduled for presentation.</p><p>The IEEE reserves the right to exclude or remove a paper from from IEEE Xplore® if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p><p>For detailed information on conference registration go to the ICODSE 2022 Conference <a href="./registration.html">Registration page</a>.</p><h3 id="2-formatting-and-ieee-xplore-compliance">2. Formatting and IEEE Xplore® Compliance</h3><p>Your accepted paper will appear on IEEE Xplore® – the IEEE Digital Library – and it is important that your submitted PDF file meets the specification for IEEE Xplore®. Failing to submit an IEEE Xplore® compatible PDF file may result in the file not being included in the conference proceedings. Please refer to the IEEE document “Simplified Requirements for Creating PDF Files for IEEE Xplore®” for more information.</p><p>In order to assure that all submitted PDF files are IEEE Xplore® compliant, your paper must pass format check in IEEE PDFXpress.</p><p>You must use IEEE PDF eXpress™ to generate or verify an IEEE Xplore® compliant PDF. We strongly recommend that all final submissions be created using the IEEE PDF eXpress™ service. The IEEE PDF eXpress™ service can convert your paper from a wide range of formats to IEEE Xplore®-compatible PDFs. The service is free of charge for ICoDSE 2022 authors and can be accessed using the following information:</p><ol><li>Go to the IEEE PDF eXpress® Login Page (<a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ieee-pdf-express.org/</a>)</li><li>Select the “Create account” link.</li><li>Enter the following:<ul><li>Conference ID: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">53690X</span></li><li>your email address</li><li>a password</li></ul></li><li>Continue to enter information as prompted.</li></ol><p>An Online confirmation will be displayed and an email confirmation will be sent verifying your account setup.</p><p>Previous users of PDF eXpress or IEEE PDF eXpress Plus need to follow the above steps, but should enter the same password that was used for previous conferences. Verify that your contact information is valid.</p><p>The following information is intended to guide you on formatting your final paper, ensuring your PDF file is IEEE Xplore® compliant.</p><h4 id="page-limit">Page limit</h4><p>The page limit for regular (full) papers is six (6) pages. Please use the extra page in full papers for addressing the comments of the reviewers, make your figures large enough to be legible, and to comply with all formatting requirements. Please note that it is not possible to purchase extra pages.</p><h4 id="templates">Manuscript Templates</h4><p>Please format your final submission using the guidelines provided in: <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>.</p><p>The guidelines are implemented in the following templates:</p><p>Only in case you are unable to use LaTex, other text processors may be used at your own risk. IEEE provides a template for Word in A4 size. Your final submission must follow all IEEE conference formatting requirements (e.g., font sizes, margins, and layout). Thus, check them really carefully.</p><p>Some important notes:</p><ol><li>Any running headers/footers or page-numbers must be removed.</li><li>Blue-underlining for URLs and email addresses should be removed.</li><li><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Prepare the final manuscript with no page numbering.</span></li></ol><h3 id="3-paper-upload">3. Paper Upload</h3><p>Before uploading your paper, please:</p><ol><li>Check that title and abstract in EasyChair match your camera-ready paper exactly. If it is different, please send an email to ICoDSE chair (icodse@informatika.org).</li><li>Please use Title Case for the paper title, i.e. capitalizing all main words.</li><li>Compare all author names in EasyChair with the author list in your paper. They must be identical and in the same order.</li><li>Enter all middle names/initials you prefer to use in the paper in the author profile at EasyChair as well.</li><li>Ensure that special characters in the paper match the EasyChair entry.</li><li>Have the PDF checked or created by IEEE PDFXpress; upload the certified file returned from IEEE PDFXpress into EasyChair.</li><li>Put together the auxiliary files (Microsoft Words documents, Latex documents, figures, etc) that are necessary to build the camera ready pdf file into one zip file. Send the zip file to icodse@informatika.org. The zip file have to be able to be opened/extracted.</li></ol><p>This is very important because we will be using the information provided in EasyChair to generate the final conference program and the table of contents for IEEE Xplore®. Please note that the abstract and title should be readable on its own and not contain any references or unexplained acronyms.</p><p>In case you need to modify the title or the abstract, you can do this through EasyChair. Changes to the list of authors, allowed only under exceptional circumstances, and have to be approved by TPC chairs. All the camera-ready papers have to be submitted via EasyChair by<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 25 October 2021</span>.</p><h3>4.
